Two more mayors in the Philippines were assassinated this month, bringing the total to at least 10 mayors killed since President Rodrigo Duterte took office in 2016. The slayings are believed to be political and related to Duterte’s endorsement of extrajudicial killing connected to his policies aimed at curbing the country’s drug trade. It’s estimated that more than 20,000 people have been killed in relation to the drug war to date.
