This morning’s job market report was definitely good. Job creation was surprisingly strong for this late in an economic expansion; wages are finally rising, although still far more slowly than they were before the Great Recession. You never want to make too much of one month’s report, but this was clearly positive. And stocks plunged. What? One answer is that stocks gonna do what they’re gonna do – as Paul Samuelson famously put it, the market predicted nine of the last five recessions. But there’s a bit of economic logic here too. One way of looking at recent economic data is that they’re actually telling us that future U.S. growth will be lower than one might have hoped. If we care about the medium term – say, 5 or 10 years – prospects for U.S. growth depend on two things. First, how much slack is there in the economy? How many people who aren’t working can still be drawn into employment without inflation taking off? Second, how fast will productivity – output per person-hour – rise? The first question has posed something of a puzzle. Standard indicators like the unemployment rate and the quit rate suggest an economy at more or less full employment. (Quits matter because they tell us how easily workers expect to find new jobs.) But low wage growth suggested that there might still be substantial room to run. Now, finally, we may be seeing some significant wage gains: Again, you don’t want to make too much of one month’s number. But the wage gain strengthens the case that we really are near full employment; interest rates rose because the odds of Fed rate hikes to limit inflation have risen. And that hit stocks. Meanwhile, productivity numbers have been pretty dismal: So what the data are suggesting, although not with a lot of confidence, is that America is about to settle into a low-growth rut, maybe 1.5% a year. And yes, that’s only half what Trump is promising.
