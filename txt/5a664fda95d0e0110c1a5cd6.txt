This film was born out of another film that fell through because I couldn’t fund it. When you have a camera but no money, you make do with what you can. Often, that means looking around for what’s closest to you. Call it “proximity cinema,” a type of cinema for the poor. This film, about my younger brother’s experiences moving back to our family’s home in Missouri, is a good example. Filming a family member can be tricky, but luckily, my brother is a joy to be around. Following him for this film, I found him to be rambunctious and fun, brimming with energy and honesty. The camera naturally gravitates toward these traits, and watching him through my lens, I was enthralled. Ultimately I was able to turn the footage into this film structured around the framework of him moving back in with our parents. That framework wasn’t a naturally interesting topic for me, since I and all of my brothers have done this at one point as adults. But it did seem the best way to structure the material. After my first project failed, I learned much more about the ingredients for a powerful film. I knew about craft, angle and intention in abstract, but I couldn’t yet exploit them in useful ways. This film gave me the space to really think about that. Part of my understanding of cinema is that the images and sounds have to play off one another, and I wanted to experiment with that idea. So I made a cinéma vérité documentary, and what I found myself not filming became just as important as what I was choosing to film. I learned to be as specific as I could in what I was intending to show without giving unnecessary details. I wanted my images to be a persistent guide to the story. So this documentary tries to capture the energy and movement of a brief moment in my brother’s life, as well as a glimpse of my patient parents. Whether what we see in the film is the 10th, or 20th, lawn mower my parents have lost, they continue to move forward with relentless persistence.
