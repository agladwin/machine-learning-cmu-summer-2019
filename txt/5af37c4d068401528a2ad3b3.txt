Frustrated and defiant, his White House dysfunctional, President Trump has been musing about a potentially bold stroke: What if he removed his chief of staff, John Kelly, and replaced him with … no one? The president has already, by many accounts, been ignoring or circumventing Mr. Kelly. He reportedly told friends that, after all, Lyndon B. Johnson didn’t need a chief, so why does he? This is a formula for failure. It is true that President Johnson did not designate any of his aides as first among equals. But Mr. Johnson’s model of governance is completely wrong for the 45th president. Never mind that Mr. Trump, with no governing experience, is nothing like Mr. Johnson, a master legislator of the 20th century. For all his early domestic achievements, Mr. Johnson lost America’s longest war and was driven from office. (This may come as news to a president who reportedly does not read.) Every president since him has learned, sometimes the hard way, that the only thing worse than a White House with a flawed chief of staff is a White House without one. Since Richard Nixon, no president has governed effectively without a chief of staff who could execute his agenda and tell him, when necessary, what he did not want to hear. This has been especially true of “outsider” presidents: Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan — and Mr. Trump. There is nothing in the Constitution about a chief of staff, and early presidents functioned without one. But as the size and complexity of government have grown exponentially, modern presidents need someone to instill discipline, coordinate policy and carry out their agenda. Dwight Eisenhower, who created the position, installed a civilian version of his Army chief of staff: a former New Hampshire governor named Sherman Adams, a gatekeeper so gruff he was known as the “Abominable ‘No’ Man.” But John Kennedy scrapped the position. Determined to be a hands-on president, Mr. Kennedy at first governed according to a model called the “spokes of the wheel,” with a gaggle of top advisers reporting directly to him. It was a mistake. Within months, President Kennedy was embroiled in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. After the debacle, believing his generals had lied to him, he leaned heavily on his brother Bobby as a de facto chief of staff and teller of hard truths. Richard Nixon took the model of a strong chief of staff to another level. H. R. Haldeman, known as Bob — his “pluperfect son of a bitch,” as Nixon called him — created the template for the modern position. Mr. Haldeman controlled the president’s schedule and access to the Oval Office, making time and space for Mr. Nixon to think. He made sure that only the toughest decisions reached the Oval Office. He took charge of communications and speechwriting. And he was, as Mr. Nixon called him, his “lord high executioner,” herding the cabinet into line. It all came apart when the Watergate scandal struck, forcing Nixon from office and sending Mr. Haldeman to prison. Yet they created the model that presidents ever since have strayed from at their peril. Gerald Ford strayed, and paid the price. At first he gave his advisers equal, freewheeling access to the Oval Office. (A management model much like the 26th floor of Trump Tower.) The experiment was a disaster — like “learning by fire hose,” said an aide. He soon installed a tough chief of staff named Donald Rumsfeld, who, along with his young deputy Dick Cheney, brought discipline, and results, to the White House. Jimmy Carter became the ultimate cautionary tale of trying to govern without a chief. Trained as a nuclear submarine naval officer and convinced he could run the White House himself, Mr. Carter served, in effect, as his own chief — managing everything from his schedule to reservations for the White House tennis court. But he was politically tone-deaf, immersed in detail and unwilling to prioritize. About two and a half years into his presidency, with his agenda stalled, the 39th president realized his mistake and reluctantly appointed a chief of staff. The lesson of this current presidency — the most chaotic in modern history — is not that Mr. Trump would somehow be better off unchained. After more than a year, it is clear that he has learned nothing about governing. Ronald Reagan understood that an outsider president needs a consummate insider to tell him what he does not want to hear; he found that person in the form of his first chief, James A. Baker III; without Mr. Baker’s no-holds-barred advice, there probably would have been no Reagan revolution. Mr. Trump desperately needs a chief of staff who will tell him hard truths. Foremost among those is something Mr. Reagan and Mr. Baker understood: There is a difference between campaigning, which is dividing, demonizing and disrupting — and governing, which is building coalitions and making compromises. It’s said that in Hollywood no one knows anything. In Washington, all too often, no one learns anything. Donald Trump is not the first commander in chief to disregard the lessons of his predecessors. On his last day in Gerald Ford’s White House, a 34-year-old Dick Cheney, who had succeeded Donald Rumsfeld as chief of staff, decided to leave behind a gift for the incoming administration. He propped it up on his desk, where he knew Jimmy Carter’s top aide, Hamilton Jordan, would be sure to find it. It was a mangled bicycle wheel. Cheney attached a note: “Dear Hamilton,” it read. “Beware the spokes of the wheel.”
