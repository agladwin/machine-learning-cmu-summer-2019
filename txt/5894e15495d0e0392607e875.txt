An early poll finds that President Trump’s suspension of the refugee program was popular. I think that’s partly because many Americans fear terrorism and the word “refugee” unfairly and inaccurately conjures an image of a prospective terrorist. So I’ve prepared this video telling the story of Elena, 14, who was forced into a relationship with a gang member in Honduras when she was only eleven. Her family members were threatened and soon after, they fled their home. People like Elena are not economic migrants. They are refugees, escaping violence and desperate for asylum. Do we really want to send kids like Elena home to be murdered? This is one of several videos I made with Show of Force as part of their project called Humanity on the Move, addressing forced migration and the global refugee crisis. A special thanks to the team there, especially Jessica Chermayeff, for making it with me. In this same series, you can see my video about my own refugee roots, and a video about President Trump’s roots and his hypocrisy when he vilifies immigrants. Sure, refugees bring challenges, including security risks. They also bring hard work, diversity and global connections. On balance, they strengthen this country, and they deserve our protection — and girls like Elena should prick our conscience when we turn our backs on them. Watch Elena’s story.
