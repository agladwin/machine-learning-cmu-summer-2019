One vignette into how the debate over whether to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act has touched a national nerve: A tweet of mine showing what could happen to premium costs for Americans with pre-existing conditions went viral two days ago, well beyond any of my previous tweets. Any elected official who voted for the House Republican health care plan, which passed on Thursday afternoon, should have considered reactions like these. But instead, by a party-line vote, the House replaced a plan with a 54 percent approval rating with one that had a 17 percent approval rating even before amendments made it less consumer-friendly.
