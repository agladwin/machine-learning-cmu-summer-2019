On Tuesday, a federal judge blocked attempts by a gun activist to post schematics for a gun that can be produced by a 3-D printer. If you feel America just dodged a giant bullet, you’re only partly right. There are still more than 393 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States, which means there are more guns than people. If that makes you feel unsafe, visit Australia. In Australia, it took one mass shooting in Port Arthur in 1996, where 35 people were killed, for the country to do something concrete about gun reform. The government adopted tighter gun control, banned semiautomatic weapons and started a mandatory gun buyback program.  The United States, meanwhile, has an average of nine mass shootings every 10 days, and 13,000 gun homicides a year. Gun violence is so rampant that China has warned its citizens about traveling here.  So if you’re interested in not getting shot to death and adorable koalas, Australia might be the place for you.
