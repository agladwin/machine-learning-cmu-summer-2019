We know today why it took the United States so long to disengage from Vietnam: Leaving meant showing weakness in the face of the global Communist menace, prompting a backlash at home and the loss of America’s credibility among allies. But if America’s involvement is well understood, the same cannot be said of its superpower nemesis, the Soviet Union. What did the Russians stand to gain from backing a remote jungle war, sending advisers, matériel and money to help the North Vietnamese, even when doing so not only put Soviet-American relations on ice but also risked causing a global conflagration? Was it Vietnam’s geopolitical importance? Or, perhaps, Moscow’s preoccupation with spreading revolutionary ideology? We often attribute to the other side more foresight and purpose than we allow our own. There were in fact remarkable parallels between American and Soviet involvement in Vietnam. Like the United States, what Moscow was most concerned about was its credibility as an ally and a superpower and the domestic and international legitimacy that such credibility afforded. Nikita Khrushchev, who pioneered the Soviet pivot to the third world in the 1950s, had limited interest in and little patience with the North Vietnamese, whom he eyed with suspicion, especially after Hanoi began to tilt visibly to China’s side in the unfolding Sino-Soviet split. Advertisement North Vietnam’s siding with China was a tactical move in the absence of better options. Khrushchev himself precipitated this shift by refusing to provide aid. But he blamed his loss of North Vietnam on the imaginary machinations of “Chinese half-breeds” in the Vietnamese party leadership. For Khrushchev, the problem of Vietnam was only an aspect of his broader struggle with China, and a rather peripheral aspect at that. All of that changed when Khrushchev was ousted by his colleagues in a palace coup in October 1964. His successors, Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin, wanted to prove that they were truly committed to an ally in need by providing military aid. The underlying rationale was that the new Soviet leadership faced a deficit of political legitimacy. Aiding Vietnam in a war against “imperialism” helped them in being recognized — by their people, their clients and allies and the broader world — as the legitimate heirs to the leadership of the socialist camp. For the same reason, Moscow attempted to improve relations with China. Mao Zedong, however, was not inclined to reciprocate. This became clear during Kosygin’s February 1965 trip to Beijing. Kosygin, the Soviet premier, spoke of the need for “united action” to help Hanoi’s war effort. Mao responded to his pleas with hostile sarcasm, telling Kosygin that the Sino-Soviet struggle would last for 10,000 years. “The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are now deciding the world’s destiny,” Mao said acidly. “Well, go ahead and decide.” He appeared unconcerned by the new round of escalation in Vietnam: “So what? What is horrible about the fact that some number of people died?” — and countered Kosygin’s worries about the deepening conflict with optimistic calls for a “revolutionary war.” Even as Moscow’s relations with China continued to deteriorate, Hanoi moved away from a pro-Chinese stand to a semblance of neutrality. That was because the North Vietnamese needed the Soviet weapons, especially advanced antiaircraft missiles, to protect themselves against American bombing. But the Chinese Cultural Revolution also helped. The Vietnamese leaders resented Beijing’s effort to stir up radicalism among the sizable community of Chinese living in North Vietnam. “As paradoxical as it sounds,” remarked one Politburo member, Nguyen Van Vinh, in 1967, at the height of American involvement, the Vietnamese “do not fear the Americans but fear the Chinese comrades.” This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

The tensions between Beijing and Hanoi became much more pronounced in 1971, after Henry Kissinger’s secret trip to China and the announcement of Nixon’s impending visit. The North Vietnamese were not consulted and felt betrayed. But there was an even bigger problem: The Chinese and the Vietnamese had very different ideas about their relative importance. The Chinese leaders regarded the North Vietnamese as underlings. They helped them. They instructed them. But they expected deference in return. The Vietnamese refused to defer. After years of fighting against the United States, they felt entitled to claim revolutionary leadership, at least in Southeast Asia. This was the message that Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap brought to Moscow in December 1971 just as the Vietnamese geared up for the Spring Offensive to deal the final blow to South Vietnam. Giap promised that the joint Soviet-Vietnamese victory in Vietnam would herald Hanoi’s rise to ranks of the leader of, and the socialist bridgehead to the third world. “We would like to carry on this mission together with the Soviet Union, because no one can do it without the Soviet Union,” he said. The Soviet leaders embraced the message, especially after Giap promised to allow the Soviet Union naval rights in then-still American-controlled Cam Ranh Bay. There were dangers in supporting Hanoi’s militant attitude. The restart of major fighting in March 1972 threatened to derail the move toward the Soviet-American détente. After the Americans responded to Hanoi’s Spring Offensive by massive bombing raids, several in the Soviet leadership, including Kosygin, proposed to cancel the upcoming summit in Moscow. “Are you kidding?,” Brezhnev asked. “Why not!,” Kosygin countered. “This would be the right kind of a bomb.” “It’ll be a bomb all right,” Brezhnev commented, “but who will it affect more?” Brezhnev regarded détente as a personal achievement and was not willing to sacrifice it for the sake of Vietnam. At the same time, though, he was also unwilling to pressure Vietnam for the sake of a better relationship with the United States, the idea known to Kissinger and Nixon as “linkage.” What the American duo did not quite understand was that Vietnam was an important element of Brezhnev’s bid for global leadership. Soviet support for Hanoi was what made the Soviet Union a true superpower and America’s equal. Advertisement Nixon later recalled being taken aback during the May 1972 Moscow Summit when Brezhnev, “who had just been laughing and slapping me on the back, started shouting angrily,” accusing the United States of committing terrible crimes in Vietnam. Brezhnev did it because he had to defend his credibility in front of his own colleagues and also the North Vietnamese. “I don’t remember that I or my comrades ever had to speak to anyone so sharply and so harshly as we spoke to Nixon about Vietnam,” Brezhnev later told General Secretary Le Duan and Prime Minister Pham Van Dong. Sino-Vietnamese relations at that time had reached new lows. By the summer of 1973, as the United States was completing its disengagement, Le Duan worried about China, telling Brezhnev that he thought Mao planned “to invade all of Indochina and Southeast Asia if the circumstances were right.” Brezhnev promised to help defend Vietnam — this time against its northern neighbor. The costs of postwar reconstruction were enormous. Le Duan and Pham Van Dong were upfront with Brezhnev about Hanoi’s expectations: There would have to be a major Soviet aid effort to help “industrialize” Vietnam in order to show Southeast Asia the practical benefits of socialist orientation. “We have nothing,” Le Duan told Brezhnev, suggesting that everything would have to come from the Soviet bloc for the next 10 to 15 years. Brezhnev agreed to cancel all of Hanoi’s debts. Credits kept coming, though, and by 1990 Vietnam had received more than $11 billion dollars in aid, most of which was never repaid. Subsidizing Vietnam became a serious burden on the Soviet economy in 1980s, contributing to Moscow’s insolvency. The Vietnam War ended with the Soviet-Vietnamese victory but, for Moscow at least, it was a Pyrrhic victory. Maintaining clients was good for one’s credibility as a superpower and for the leaders’ political legitimacy, but it wasn’t good for the state budget. Russia’s policy in recent years, in particular its operations in Syria, is reminiscent of the Cold War-era quest for legitimacy in Vietnam. The long-term consequences of this renewed quest will be equally dire. Sergey Radchenko is a professor of international relations at Cardiff University, Wales.
