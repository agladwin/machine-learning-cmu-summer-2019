In 2012, after a distinguished career in higher education, which included serving as the president of Smith College and Brown University — where she was the first black woman to lead an Ivy League institution — Ruth J. Simmons retired and moved back to her home state, Texas. She didn’t think she’d ever work at a university again. But after several years, Prairie View A&M University, a historically black school with about 9,000 students, came calling. “I was quite surprised to be approached about the opportunity,” Dr. Simmons told me, but “I also went to an H.B.C.U. — Dillard University — and I’m very much aware of the ways in which these colleges play a role for many students.” After several months as interim president of the university, she accepted the permanent position in October 2017. I asked Dr. Simmons to talk about her new role and plans for Prairie View because she has been at the forefront of many trends in higher education. At Brown, she established need-blind admissions for undergraduates (the last of the Ivy League to do so). In 2003, she commissioned a study of the university’s ties to the slave trade — one of the first university efforts to uncover the historical connection between academia and slavery. At Smith, she created an engineering program, the first at any all-women’s college. (Disclosure: I attended Brown and overlapped with Dr. Simmons my freshman year.) This conversation has been edited and condensed. Marguerite Joutz: Hi, Dr. Simmons. I’d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different? Ruth Simmons: Well, I’m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn’t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me. I grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school. My aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother — and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation. As president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It’s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same. M.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?  R.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government’s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don’t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don’t know. Frankly, that’s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families. M.J.: You’ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you’ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it’s much easier to lead people “if you convey the underlying principles.” Can you elaborate?  R.S.: One thing that I’ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don’t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they’re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition — the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be — how it could be different or improved perhaps — and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together. I don’t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don’t see that. I think leadership is a community affair. M.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?  R.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we’re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don’t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you’re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you’re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you’d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership. M.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.  R.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don’t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say — in an unartful or offensive way — that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn’t mean it wasn’t there before. I would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It’s out front, it’s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students. As a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don’t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn’t want any part of it, I would say, “Well, that’s just too bad!” Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You’re there to teach the world about yourself, you’re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I’d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away. M.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school. R.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history — they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education — but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer. Prairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn’t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions. M.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.  R.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference. When I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I’m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don’t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you — going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. — then you’re not thinking broadly enough. M.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today? R.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is — how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we’ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn’t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation. And I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse. So much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself — if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they’d never be respected intellectually, they’d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.
