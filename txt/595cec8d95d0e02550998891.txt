After Democrats lost yet another election last month — this one in a House race near Atlanta — the historian Daniel Williams urged the party to confront its religion problem. That problem centers on “a generational and racial divide between a largely secular group of young, white party activists and an older electorate that is more religious and more socially conservative,” Williams wrote. “Put simply, outside of a few progressive districts, secular-minded young activists in the party are unable to win voters’ trust.” In yesterday’s Times, the historians Annette Gordon-Reed and Peter Onuf offered a surprising suggestion for where Democrats can find a solution to their religion problem: Thomas Jefferson. To be clear, Gordon-Reed and Onuf aren’t claiming to be offering political advice; they’re talking instead about broader civic values. But I was struck by the connection between the Jeffersonian values they describe and the Democrats’ modern-day religion struggles. Jefferson infused his political philosophy with Christian values, even though he was not a deeply religious man in the traditional sense. “He adhered to the ‘philosophy’ of Jesus while rejecting ‘mystifications’ that offended his steadfast belief in science and were, in his view, the chief cause of religious strife,” Gordon-Reed and Onuf write. “He was confident that enlightened republicans and conscientious Christians could, and must, agree on the fundamental ethical precepts he gleaned from the Bible.” Oh, and something else: His political opponents argued that he wasn’t really religious and spread rumors about his supposed atheism. But Jefferson still managed to be a pretty successful politician. I encourage you to read the piece.
