As someone who’s done a lot of research and writing over the years, I always have mixed feelings when someone enthuses about a paper I published in, say, 1991. On the one hand, it’s great to know that people appreciate my work. On the other hand, couldn’t they pick something a bit more, you know, recent? So I feel slightly bad about this week’s pick. I discovered Warpaint very late in the game, and love some of the recent performances on YouTube (still haven’t seen them live.) But my favorite is still this 2010 performance, quite early in the band’s history, which really shows off the talent of all four women, with two lead guitarists/vocalists and that amazing bass/drums gestalt.
