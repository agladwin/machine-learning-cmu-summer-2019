Our list of President Trump’s lies continues to generate reader interest and feedback. My colleague Stuart Thompson and I appreciate that interest and wanted to ask your advice for extending the project. We also wanted to ask whether you think our list — which we billed as definitive — missed any of the president’s untruths since taking office. Our standard is a demonstrably false statement. If you think we missed any, please send an email to leonhardt@nytimes.com with the statement, the date and documentation of its falseness. As for the project’s next stage: Some of the president’s defenders have argued on social media that his penchant for lying is no different than other recent presidents. We are skeptical of that notion, but we’re also open to evidence. So if you can recall falsehoods that Presidents Barack Obama or George W. Bush told, send us an email with them. Documentation is ideal, but not necessary. (No need to email us about Obama telling people they could keep their health insurance or Bush claiming that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; we’re aware of those claims.) Finally, we welcome any broader advice from readers. If we update the Trump project in coming months, should we change it in any way? For example, would it be useful if we included a link for each statement, allowing readers to see documentation of its falseness? If you’re interested in more details on the project, Stuart discussed it with Lawrence O’Donnell on MSNBC, and I talked about it on Jacob Weisberg’s podcast, Trumpcast. We also enjoyed the verdict of the world’s leading expert on fantasy. Don’t miss this delightful tweet, either.
