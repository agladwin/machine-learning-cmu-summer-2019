The field seems increasingly female. (I recently spoke to a college journalism seminar without a single male student in it.) Yet opinion journalism remains disturbingly male. I’ve been at too many gatherings of columnists, from multiple news organizations, where a room of 10 or 12 writers included only one or two women. Virtually every national publication, including The Times, can do better. The same is true on television, in politics and in other areas. Rachel Nichols, of ESPN, once pointed out that the typical sports broadcast involved multiple men offering their opinions about the game, along with a single female reporter on the sidelines who spent a lot of time holding a microphone in front of athletes. I’m reminded of her comment almost every time I watch a sporting event. The problem that Nichols and Weiner are describing — call it the invent-transcribe imbalance — is one that should be eminently solvable. On other topics: I recommend The Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin on Democratic glee over zombie Trumpcare (which helps explain why it failed yesterday, once again) and Elizabeth Williamson in The Times on this year’s Trump-free White House Correspondents’ Dinner.
