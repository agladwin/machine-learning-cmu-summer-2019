In the video op-ed above, the British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi stands in solidarity with the Iranian teenager Maedeh Hojabri. Iranian security agents arrested Ms. Hojabri in May for posting videos of herself dancing on Instagram, where she has tens of thousands of followers. In response to the Islamic republic’s crackdown, countless supporters around the world posted videos of themselves dancing on social media with the hashtag #dancingisnotacrime. Such activism follows a series of acts of civil disobedience against Iran’s decades-long restrictions on women’s freedom. Recently women have disguised themselves as men to enter sports stadiums and publicly removed their government-mandated head scarves, a risky form of protest that has led to arrests. “Maedeh’s arrest shows that Iran denies even the most personal and nonpolitical acts of expression, a basic and universal human right,” Ms. Boniadi says. Nazanin Boniadi is an actress, an activist for Amnesty International and a board member at the Center for Human Rights in Iran.
