There were plenty of eye-popping outfits on display at the Met Gala on Monday night. But this year, the most memorable (and meme-able) items weren’t the elaborate trains or intricately designed dresses. Instead, it was the wide variety of halos, crowns, hats and veils that won the red carpet. Beyoncé may not have been present, but halos were in full effect on the red carpet.  Other celebrities eschewed angelic accessories and instead opted for royal regalia, wearing crowns and tiaras fit for a coronation.  Some stars sported headgear that was fit for the Kentucky Derby or next week’s royal wedding in London. A number of attendees seemed inspired by the medieval history of Catholicism.
