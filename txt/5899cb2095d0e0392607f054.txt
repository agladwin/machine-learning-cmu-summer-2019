Betsy DeVos has become the Trump nominee that liberals are trying the hardest to defeat — inspiring the #DeVosPledge — and I understand why. Education sparks passion among many Democrats (sometimes productively, sometimes less so), and DeVos has some alarming positions. She has shown scant interest in holding charter schools and private schools accountable for their results. She has also shown little commitment to special education. And she apparently has strange views about the risk of bear maulings on school campuses. Whatever you think of DeVos, however, I’ve come to think that the focus on her has become too concentrated — and that there is another nominee who deserves more attention than he has received. Tom Price, the nominee to run Health and Human Services, can likely have a bigger impact in that job than DeVos can have as education secretary. The highly localized nature of American education naturally limits DeVos’s ability to privatize schools, as Kevin Carey of the New America Foundation has noted. Price, on the other hand, would have the authority to weaken or undermine health insurance for millions of people if he’s confirmed. He’s sent strong signals that he would like to do so, too. Perhaps even more important, Price — a Georgia Congressman and orthopedic surgeon — has compiled a long list of questionable behavior, mostly in the service of enriching himself. My column this morning tells the story of this behavior. The issues with Price’s nomination aren’t merely ideological. They’re ethical. And while presidents deserve deference on the ideology of their nominees, they don’t deserve deference on basic ethics.
