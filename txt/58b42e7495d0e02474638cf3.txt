On most issues, women are significantly more liberal than men, young Americans are more liberal than older Americans and African-Americans are more liberal than whites. But there is at least one big exception — a major issue on which the views of the two sexes, different races and different age groups are fairly similar. That issue may surprise you: abortion. I think this fact highlights the moral complexity of abortion. Some issues — gay marriage and voting restrictions, for example — are straightforward, if still controversial, matters of civil rights. But abortion is different. It requires unavoidable tradeoffs. Abortion opponents favor laws that deny women control over their own bodies. Proponents of abortion access, meanwhile, favor laws that permit the taking of human life. Today’s Op-Ed page wades into this debate with a piece by Lauren Enriquez, a pro-life advocate at Human Coalition. I disagree with major chunks of her argument, and she chose to emphasize that most women favor abortion restrictions (true) rather than that most women favor fairly broad abortion access (also true). But I think she’s right that the progressive movement will be stronger if it’s willing to welcome abortion opponents. “As a woman who has been involved in the pro-life movement for my entire adult life,” Enriquez writes, “I want to obliterate the stereotype that the people working to end abortion hate women.” Remember that public opinion on abortion also doesn’t split neatly by age. Young people are only moderately more in favor of abortion than older people, which suggests that this debate isn’t going away anytime soon.
