They rose to applaud the president again and again last night, and in doing so they projected an image of Republican unity. But Congressional Republicans and the White House are not really unified. The divisions are creating problems for President Trump. They help explain his historically low approval ratings for a new president, as well as his failure to start his term with a burst of substantial legislation, as Barack Obama did. How can I say that the Republicans are divided when their Congressional leaders are supporting Trump on most issues (like his tax returns, his nominees and the immigration crackdown)? The political scientist Matt Glassman had the best summary I’ve seen, in a recent tweetstorm. “First, it is radically unusual that party Senators are opposing the President AT ALL. It’s basically unprecedented,” Glassman wrote. “In a normal presidency, party Senators would be on TV constantly, pushing the President’s message and defending his policies.” Today, many are not. Some members of Congress are quiet. Others, like John McCain and Ben Sasse, have already opposed Trump in high-profile ways. The president obviously has his own levers of power, like executive actions, and Trump is using those. Four years is also a long time, and Republicans will probably find ways to come together — to cut taxes, for example. But don’t be fooled by Trump giving himself an “A” for his early performance or by the standing ovations last night. The Republicans are off to a rough start.
