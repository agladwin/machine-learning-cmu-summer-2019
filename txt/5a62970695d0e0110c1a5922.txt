In recent months, with New York’s increasingly woebegone subway system struggling to fix its problems, a conundrum has emerged: As the city’s population grows, subway ridership is falling. So what could the subway’s operator, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, do to find more commuters upon whom to inflict its suffering? Taking a cue from the wellness industry, encourage riders to seize upon the M.T.A.’s leisurely pace and spotty Wi-Fi service as an opportunity to unwind from the frenzy of modern life. Publicize studies showing that commuters maintain agile minds from years of working out byzantine transport calculations. Remind commuters that with their MetroCard, they are effectively gaining a complimentary gym membership. Start a public health initiative urging riders to strengthen their immune systems through constant exposure to the subway’s seats and poles. Lure impressionable tourists with newfangled attractions. Capitalize on the subway’s storied history with a wistful advertising campaign drenched in New York nostalgia. Fire sale. Mike Reddy is an illustrator and designer.
