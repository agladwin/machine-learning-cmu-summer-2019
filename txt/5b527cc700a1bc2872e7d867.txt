The cards will open the door to culture in New York. By Damon Winter Van Gogh, Hopper, the frangipani. These are only some of New York’s artistic treasures that have brought tourists to the city for generations. Now, they will be accessible to millions of additional New Yorkers, too, thanks to a new city initiative aimed at giving more residents access to iconic cultural destinations. All one needs is a public library card.  The new program, Culture Pass, will offer free admission to more than 30 institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Sugar Hill Children’s Museum and the Louis Armstrong House. These are the cultural riches that make New York great, but for far too long, the price of admission was too high for far too many who lived here. Thankfully, the Culture Pass will help fix that.
