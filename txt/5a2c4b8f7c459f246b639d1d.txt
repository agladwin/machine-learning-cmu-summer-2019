Dear Colleagues, It’s that time of year again — time for our Secret Santa Office Party! You may remember that for the past eight years, we called it the Office Gift Exchange, but now that we can legally say “Merry Christmas,” let’s go for it and say Secret Santa! We wanted to share with you some updated guidelines this year to make the Secret Santa party fun for everyone: • Keep gifts in the $10-and-under range. • Please be sensitive to Art’s tree-nut allergy. • Everyone loves gourmet coffee, but Monica wants you to know she drinks decaf! • We draw names at random. Please do not target a specific co-worker with your special gift. • Remember, this is voluntary! You can’t force your colleagues to participate, even if you have something you really, really want to give them. • No sex toys. • No secret door-locking buttons, real or pretend. • No potted plants. • No unsolicited naughty pics. • No solicited naughty pics. • No soliciting of naughty pics. • No pressing your clothed but tumescent genitalia against your colleague’s back while whispering, “Psst … the best gifts are homemade.” • No signing of high school yearbooks. Dress code: Festive! Please, no walking around in a bathrobe or towel, pursuing perceived shared feelings. There will be a cash bar and light appetizers. Remember to drink responsibly! Please, no behaving in a manner that is not, so you say, reflective of who you really are (even if you came of age in the ’60s and ’70s), prompting you to recognize the depth of the damage that you have caused while your full-time job becomes one of stepping back, listening and soul-searching. Also, no masturbating. We’ve all worked hard this year, people! Let’s come together to celebrate the season in a way that won’t have a negative impact on the professional and personal lives of the people you work with and bring pain to your family, friends and especially to your children and your wife!
