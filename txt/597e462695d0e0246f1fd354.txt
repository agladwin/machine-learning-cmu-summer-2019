China and India, two nuclear-armed nations, have come near the brink of conflict over a contested region in the Himalayas at the point where Bhutan, China and India meet. The standoff began in June after Chinese troops began working to extend a road through the Dolam Plateau. It is one of the worst border disputes between the countries in more than 30 years.
