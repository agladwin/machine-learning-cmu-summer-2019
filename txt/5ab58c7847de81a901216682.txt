An explanation for readers who may not have followed my old blog: In my later years I have found myself, unexpectedly, a fan of indie music, and began running a regular feature I called “Friday night music,” with performance videos by bands I like – sometimes ones I shot myself, sometimes pulled off others. When the blog got folded into the column, so that what are basically blog posts are listed along with regular op-ed articles, I got inhibited; what had been more personal seemed almost inappropriate alongside serious pieces on trade policy and tax reform. But you know what? The hell with it. I’m going to revive the series, this time with an old favorite, whom I was lucky enough to catch up with (and meet!) early in their rising arc. One of the things I love about indie bands is how different their approaches are, ranging from practically orchestral (San Fermin) to interplay among equal players (Warpaint, Lone Bellow, Wild Reeds) to bands built around a stunningly talented star (Samantha Fish). Lucius is built around Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig, who always sing in unison, with awesomely gorgeous harmonies. I saw them again last night at Town Hall, where the only thing as amazing as the band was the bond with the audience. I shot a couple of videos on my phone, but the lighting was, I think, too theatrical for my equipment. Luckily someone else did a better job, so here’s one snapshot from a wonderful evening:
