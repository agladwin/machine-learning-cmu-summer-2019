On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday, I presented charts explaining that while President Trump has been dispatching self-congratulatory tweets about his economic stewardship, he has little to brag about, apart from the stock market. The economy continues to grow and add jobs at roughly the same rate it did under President Barack Obama. While Mr. Trump did get a post-election bump according to a number of metrics, that glow has faded. Trump voters appear to be increasingly frustrated with everything from the new administration’s failure to enact significant legislation to Mr. Trump’s tweets. This University of Michigan chart shows how consumer expectations jumped immediately after the election but have since dropped back to below where they were last November and close to recent lows. Declining confidence may be part of why retail sales growth has recently been slowing. As this chart shows, retail spending had been increasing steadily at 3.5 percent to 5 percent. Here again, President Trump may have gotten a post-election bump, but more recently, core retail sales growth has dropped to 2.6 percent, the lowest in more than three years. Other indicators, like the second-quarter forecast for gross domestic product, have been steadily revised downward because of the lack of progress on policy priorities and continued Washington dysfunction. This has dashed hopes for the 3 percent sustained growth rate promised by the Trump administration and contributed to growing concern among economists. Late last year, about 40 percent of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal thought the economy was more likely to underperform their growth forecasts. After the election, that percentage dropped to 25 percent. Now it is up to 57 percent, the highest since before November of last year.
