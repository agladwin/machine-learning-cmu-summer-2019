Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan last week proposed revising the country’s pacifist Constitution that has been in place since 1947. Japan has faced escalating security threats from North Korea, and Mr. Abe said he wants to make “explicit the status” of Japan’s self-defense forces and amend the Constitution by 2020.
