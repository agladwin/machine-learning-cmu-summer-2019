More than 40 years after its end, the Vietnam War remains, for Americans, essentially an American experience, or more accurately, an American metaphor. The continuing American inability and unwillingness to include the Vietnamese perspective also speaks volumes about how the United States relates to the rest of the world. Americans want to be understood but rarely want to understand others. Hollywood movies have been particularly powerful in shaping America’s Vietnam War narrative. The story line may change, but the backdrop is the same. Chaos, not just wartime chaos, not just the proverbial “war is hell” chaos, but its Asiatic variant — with the inscrutable and unknowable always lurking and pouncing upon the naïve American protagonist. Predictably, as in “Apocalypse Now,” there were fetid rivers, torrid jungles and impassive brown faces as backdrops to an American soldier’s odyssey through the heart of darkness that is Vietnam. The overarching theme was Vietnam’s meaninglessness and what it did to Americans and America. There was always the tortured, psychologically unglued Vietnam veteran like the one in “The Deer Hunter.” Metaphor takes over as American prisoners of war were forced to endure Russian roulette, a supposedly popular game played in back alleys by natives who seemingly have little value for life. Whether this game existed was irrelevant. It served to symbolize the brutality of war and the lunacies of this particular war. In “Full Metal Jacket,” the main character, Private Joker, wore both a peace symbol and the slogan “Born to Kill.” The contradictions and ironies of Vietnam became more obvious when an officer declared that henceforth “search and destroy” missions would be described more palatably as “sweep and clear.” “Platoon” changed the dominant narrative of the crazed Vietnam vet, rehabilitating him by recreating the whole picture to depict, as Oliver Stone put it, “what it was like to be there.” In the quest for authenticity, a former Marine Corps captain put the actors through a 14-day boot camp. They ate military rations, were forbidden to shower, and had to sleep in the jungle, with real-night watch rotations. Special packs of Marlboro cigarettes were made with the shade of cherry-red that match the Marlboros of the 1960s. No attempt was made to portray the Vietnamese authentically. In scenes where Vietnamese villagers huddled in the background, the language they spoke was not Vietnamese. It was not even any real language but rather deep-throated grunts meant to simulate native talk. To be fair, all this changed when Mr. Stone made his next Vietnam movie, “Heaven and Earth,” which broke new ground because the central character was a Vietnamese woman and because the movie paid attention to the details of Vietnam village custom — from lacquering teeth as protection against cavities to chewing betel nut. But the meticulousness of “Heaven and Earth” remains a rarity in Hollywood. Other Vietnam movies were vehicles for American soul searching about involvement in the war. “Born on the Fourth of July” depicts a soldier’s transformation from gung-ho veteran to war protester. The pendulum swings the other way with “Rambo,” about a one-man army who overcame resistance from pusillanimous politicians at home to return to Vietnam to rescue American P.O.W.s. There is no ambiguity or skepticism about America here. Part heroic fantasy, part bloodthirsty revenge, “Rambo” gets to replay the war as it could have been, asking, “do we get to win this time?” The Vietnamese remain irrelevant and invisible even in the universe of the novel. A novel can accommodate complexity of plot and character. But American writers for the most part are uninterested in and indifferent to the Vietnamese. In “The Things They Carried,” Tim O’Brien tells the interrelated stories of men from a single platoon and the things they took to war, down to the smallest details: can openers, pocketknives, wristwatches, mosquito repellent, chewing gum, cigarettes, salt tablets, Kool-Aid, matches, sewing kits, C rations, along with weapons — and of course grief. Encounters with the Vietnamese were barely worth a nod, and as far as allied Vietnamese soldiers were concerned, they were pithily dismissed by the narrator as “useless.” Other notable Vietnam novels, such as “13th Valley,” “Matterhorn,” “A Rumor of War,” “Fields of Fire” and “Tree of Smoke,” have been celebrated as telling the war as it truly was — drudgery, demoralization, disinformation, dehumanization. They also all center on an American central character transformed in one way or another by a place that was not a country but a vehicle for American metamorphosis. But in the realm of movies and literature, one might say creators have poetic license. Historical endeavors, such as the Ken Burns-Lynn Novick 2017 PBS documentary, or the Vietnam War exhibitions presented by the New-York Historical Society and the National Archives, would surely be different. They were not. All presented the Vietnam War along the same conventional trajectory that treats the Vietnamese perspective and experience as an aside. Out of the myriad photos, videos and oral histories compiled and presented by the historical society and the National Archives, the Vietnamese were granted minimal space. Certainly, there was no outright exclusion, which would have been ludicrous and damning. But one got the sense that the Vietnamese elements were perfunctory, added only to allow the exhibitions to claim inclusion. By contrast, painstaking care was devoted to showing the full range of the American experience, from the mundane and ordinary to the more pressing immediacy of war. With respect to the PBS documentary, almost universally lauded as definitive, one might object to my characterization by pointing to the many South Vietnamese who were in fact interviewed for the series. The truth is, despite professed desires to include multiple perspectives, this series privileges the American perspective, whether it is supportive or critical of the American war effort. It could have embarked on the worthwhile project of soothing American souls and healing divisions without sidelining the Vietnamese. The South Vietnamese were portrayed as incompetent and corrupt, their government bordering on illegitimate. This was done in a subtle and sophisticated way, not in the imperial manner of the past in which the West pontificates about the shortcomings of the native. South Vietnamese interviewees were allowed to express themselves in their own words. But hovering above the cacophony is the seemingly more objective and reliable narrator, Peter Coyote, whose disembodied voice signaled omniscience. His narrative was peppered with adjectives like corrupt or weak or beleaguered when describing the South Vietnamese. As a writer, I know that I write about a minor character differently from how I do my main character. The protagonist is carefully developed and infused with an active voice. By contrast, I might use my author’s prerogative of description and prescription for minor characters. From tone to space to treatment, I know that the South Vietnamese is the minor character in the American historical exposition of the Vietnam War. In the section of the PBS series about the Tet offensive of 1968, for example, there were hardly any South Vietnamese soldiers whose voices were included. Instead, their experiences were described and summarized. Even the postwar “re-education camps” and the suffering of the hundreds of thousands of “boat people” merited little time. They hardly mattered once American troops were pulled out and American P.O.W.s returned. But North Vietnamese and Vietcong voices were amply heard, one might object. How does one explain this? Including enemy voices serves American interests and elevates the American national character as one capable of healing and reconciliation. In addition, showing the enemy as dedicated and fierce also explains why the United States didn’t win the war. Simultaneously marginalizing or presenting the South Vietnamese as incompetent serves a different but related objective — it explains why despite American blood, sweat and tears, the war could not be won. In fact, the series was much more concerned with demonstrating that the war could never have been won. On this issue, the Vietnamese point of view was excluded entirely. The way the Vietnam War series portrayed Vietnam is emblematic of the way the United States relates to the world. American suffering is deemed exceptional and presented with empathy and compassion; it is never a statistic or a number. American soldiers who died in the Vietnam War have a monument that names each of them. The dead from Sept. 11 are also known as individuals, and their names are appropriately read out on the anniversary. All the American M.I.A.s from the Vietnam War must be accounted for, because they are American. American exceptionalism also means American experiences are projected as universal. Thus, the rules must change when calamity strikes America. Many countries have suffered terrorist attacks for years, and their citizens killed and maimed. But after Sept. 11, the United States argues that the global landscape has changed and new rules must be created. Waterboarding is not torture. Detention of enemies in Guantánamo away from American soil is legitimate. But the truth is that American suffering is not unique and American tragedies are not more tragic than tragedies in other countries. There are many mighty countries that are not beloved. America, however, is a beacon for many in the world because it promises inclusion. It is exceptional when it embraces others and includes within its heart the perspectives of others different from it.
