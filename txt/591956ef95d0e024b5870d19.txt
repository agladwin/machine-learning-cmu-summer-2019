President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who took office on Wednesday, departs from his conservative predecessors and President Trump, who have pressured North Korea to abandon its nuclear program through sanctions and other measures. Mr. Moonâ€™s approach is closer to the so-called Sunshine Policy developed by Roh Moo-hyun, who as president from 2003 to 2008 promoted aid and exchanges with the North in the hopes of guiding it toward nuclear disarmament.
