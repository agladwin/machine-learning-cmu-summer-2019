First, given the news, I want to remind people that the president has still refused to answer questions about contact between his campaign and Russia. It’s an unacceptable silence. Now onto the bulk of today’s newsletter: Fake quotations are in the news this week, thanks to a Republican National Committee tweet that incorrectly cited Abraham Lincoln as saying “And in the end, it’s not the years in your life that count, it’s the life in your years.” (The likely source of the quotation is a bit less inspiring than the 16th president: a 1947 advertisement for a book about aging.) Here at The Times, we see a lot of fake quotations in Op-Ed submissions, as my colleague Carmel McCoubrey, an editor, explains in a delightful piece. In honor of all great quotations, fake and real, we give you a short game this morning. Each of the below is frequently attributed to Winston Churchill or Thomas Jefferson. You need to pair each with one of four possible answers: Real Churchill, Fake Churchill, Real Jefferson or Fake Jefferson. The quiz includes two entries from each category. We’ve posted the answers on the Opinion section’s Facebook page. 1. A little rebellion, now and then, is a good thing. 2. Capitalism is the worst economic system, except for all the others. 3. Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried. 4. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. 5. Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result. 6. Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm. 7. That government is best which governs least. 8. The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do.
