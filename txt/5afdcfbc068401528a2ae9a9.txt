Three years ago, Sweet Briar, a women’s college in rural Virginia, announced that it would close after more than a century of operation. Enrollment had declined to fewer than 700 students, and the administration cited “insurmountable financial challenges.” The decision was met with an uproar. Students, faculty members and alumnae organized amid a national conversation on the future of women’s education. After a legal battle over the closing, the college reversed its decision. Today, the student body now numbers about 300, and the impact of that fight lingers. “It’s an uphill battle to let the word out that we never really did close, and that Sweet Briar is thriving,” Meredith Woo, the college’s president, told me. In 2017, Dr. Woo, a former dean of the University of Virginia, left her job in London as director of the international higher education support program at the Open Society Foundations to lead Sweet Briar. Her first year has not been without controversy: A restructuring of academic departments prompted complaints, and a commencement speaker made comments on the Me Too movement that angered some students. . I asked Dr. Woo to talk about her new role and plans for Sweet Briar, an institution at the nexus of women’s education, the liberal arts and international education. This interview has been edited and condensed. Marguerite Joutz: You’ve been president for just over a year at Sweet Briar. What have you been able to do in your first year, and what is your larger vision for the college? Meredith Woo: Well, Sweet Briar is a very unusual and interesting place. For over a century, it produced women who are leaders, women who are strong, persuasive, and roll up their sleeves to get things done. And you got some sense of it when three years ago, the alumnae got together and made a meaningful transformation in the life of the college. They wrote a very interesting chapter in the history of higher education in this country. What we have been able to do in the past year was work with the faculty, students and other stakeholders to reimagine what a distinctive liberal arts education at Sweet Briar could look like. That involved an establishment of what we call an integrated core curriculum under the theme of leadership. M.J.:  Many people are familiar with the idea of a core curriculum, but what does it mean to have a core curriculum that’s oriented around not just leadership, but women’s leadership? M.W.: At some level, all colleges profess to inculcate the qualities of leadership into their students. So in some sense, there is nothing unusual about leadership as the ultimate purpose of the liberal arts education we practice and deliver. We decided to really dive in and explore it with the faculty. And what we decided in the end was that the qualities of leadership we want in our students align nicely with the qualities we want to get out of our students through liberal arts education — the habits of the mind and other habits that we want to see in leaders. So we looked at these things and asked ourselves, “Is there a way, in a very parsimonious and powerful way, to deliver on all of these things through an integrated core curriculum?” On top of that, we added a couple of different components that we feel are important for women going forward in the 21st century. One is the emphasis on what we loosely call financial literacy. We believe that young women ought to understand the basics of accounting and marketing. The other aspect that we emphasized in our core is a scientific vocabulary with which young women can understand great issues that face our society today, whether it be climate change or the social consequences of artificial intelligence. We believe that this habit of understanding science as citizens is very important. M.J.: Could you tell us about your work in international higher education at the Open Society Foundations, specifically with the Asian University for Women in Bangladesh? M.W.: In my time directing the international higher education program, we focused on providing higher education for refugees. Higher education for refugees may sound like a luxury, but that’s really not true. In the year 2000, about 20 percent in the relevant age group around the world were enrolled in college. By 2014, that jumps up to about 35 percent, almost the same as in the United States. Now it doesn’t mean that you are sitting in a beautiful classroom such as one you’d find at Sweet Briar. It might mean that people are getting their exams delivered on donkeys’ backs or learning through TV. But the fact of the matter is that people are enrolled in higher education. If you look at a country like Syria, which was a secular nation before the civil war with a very highly literate population, education becomes critically important for the refugees who have lost everything. The only thing they’ve got is what they have in their brains. Education can situate them for the better in countries, which are not their home. So we worked with Syrian refugees to help them get education in bordering countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. The other refugee group that we worked with was the Rohingyas. They’re often considered the most persecuted people in a world where there is a lot of persecution going on. The largest group of Rohingyas living as refugees happens to be in Bangladesh. We believe deeply that the Rohingya people need leadership. And that they need to be educated, so that when the time comes, when they are freed from persecution, there will be a critical mass of people that are educated and empowered. That can lead the nation forward. And we thought that it was a good idea to educate the women first. There is an old African proverb. that if you educate men, you educate individuals. But if you educate women, you educate the nation. And the reason, obviously, is that because women will educate their families, and eventually spread the education throughout the society. I remember delivering these women to the Asian University for Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The women were shy, shellshocked and in some ways frightened, although full of hope for the future. Very soon, they just thrived. For them to speak English, to learn how to debate and speak in public, and learn all the wonderful things that you learn in a liberal arts college, was so empowering. The next time I saw them, they were even in your face a little bit — very assertive and confident. And I thought, my God, this is the kind of thing that happens perhaps in an all-women environment, but may be difficult in a coed environment for these women. M.J.:  You went from a global perch to one narrowly focused on a particular type of education. What prompted you to return to Virginia and assume the presidency at Sweet Briar? M.W.: The decision to take the job at Sweet Briar was an odd one since I have been a product of — at least in terms of teaching and management — big research universities. I was working at the Open Society Foundations on a two-year leave from the University of Virginia. After two years, I had to fish or cut bait. And at that moment, I got a call from Sweet Briar College. I knew that it was an excellent school that produces remarkable women. Sweet Briar is also an interesting part of American cultural history. The architect Ralph Adams Cram designed the campus. When you look at the original design of the campus, you can’t help but think that Sweet Briar was born as a great college. The ambition was to turn it into a significant American liberal arts college. It is unthinkable that one would relegate a wonderful place like this to the dustbin of history. M.J.: There’s been a lot of discussion related to the business model of higher education. And one of the reasons cited for the near closing of Sweet Briar was its financial situation. What are your thoughts on the financial model for small liberal arts colleges? M.W.: Well, we will thrive on the basis of great excellence and distinction. Our “tuition reset” [undergraduate tuition, fees and room and board was lowered to $34,000 for 2018-2019, from $50,000 the year before] is designed to create that distinction and communicate that at Sweet Briar what you get is an education that’s excellent, relevant, but also affordable. And what we are signaling by doing that in a very dramatic way is to say: A truly excellent and relevant education at a private institution is as affordable as that for in-state students in flagship universities. M.J.: Sweet Briar is one of two women’s colleges in the country to offer programs in engineering. Could you tell me a little bit about Sweet Briar’s engineering program? What is it like to study engineering at a women’s college? M.W.: We are, along with Smith College, the only women’s college that has an engineering program accredited by ABET [the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]. I think it is deplorable that in the dominant industries of tomorrow, there is such low representation of women. What we do is offer a truly excellent engineering education for women engineers of tomorrow in classrooms devoid of misogyny and intimidation. And when they graduate as engineers, they really are as good as any engineers being produced by large state university engineering schools. M.J.: What do you see as the future of women’s education in the United States? M.W.: I think there’s a real need and purpose to women’s education. There used to be 300 women’s colleges, at a time when a lot of prestigious universities were open only to men. But now, there are less than 40 women’s colleges. For that reason, I think that the prospects are excellent. Women’s colleges are an American phenomenon, in part, because America was one of the few nations where women could obtain higher education fairly early on. Even if there were a lot of schools where they couldn’t go, they went to women’s colleges. In the rest of the world, single-sex or all women’s colleges are actually a rarity. In the U.S., and in the rest of the world, there is recognition that single-gender colleges or all women’s colleges might not be a bad idea, especially at a time where all over the world — not only in the United States — you have a predominance of women going to colleges. But you don’t have a predominance of women in boardrooms and in the dominant industries of tomorrow. In that sense, there is recognition that there is something wrong, that perhaps there ought to be more emphasis on education that empowers women in a particular setting that’s favorable to them.
