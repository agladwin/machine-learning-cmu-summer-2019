President Trump met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey at the White House on Tuesday. Here are a few lines from the pool report. They shook hands. Trump mispronounced Erdoganâ€™s name. Great honor. Will have long and hard discussions. Know they will be successful. Great relationship. Strong and solid discussions. Did not answer questions.
