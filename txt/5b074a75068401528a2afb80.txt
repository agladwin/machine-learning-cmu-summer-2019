Splash! Memorial Day weekend marks the unofficial start of summer, and it is when we start to flock to beaches and pools, seeking out the soothing sensory world found underwater.  As you prepare for summer fun, check out some of our favorite pieces inspired by the relaxation and thrills we find when we are swimming. “There is no drug — recreational or prescription — capable of inducing the tranquil euphoria brought on by swimming,” Richard Friedman, a psychiatrist, wrote about his love of swimming and the benefits it has for our brains. Loudon Wainwright III, a singer-songwriter, wrote about the joy of swimming and what he thought were some of the best places to take the plunge. In this short film, one of the most popular videos we’ve published, swimmers face down the high dive. Would you jump? Or would you chicken out? From the journalist Mark Oppenheimer: Public pools began with progressive hope but ended in de facto segregation. It’s a history we should fight to undo, so that we can reclaim public, integrated swimming as an American summertime ritual. From the writer Bonnie Tsui: “Though we don’t all reach nirvana when we swim, swimming may well be that last refuge from connectivity — and, for some, the only way to find the solitary self.” Readers responded with their own perspectives on the joys of swimming, too.  Tim Winton writing on the endurance sport free diving: “The experience is both mindless and meditative, painful and pleasurable. This peculiar sensation, which is, I suppose, a kind of overcoming, was and remains addictive.” Something happens when you dive into a world where clocks don’t tick and inboxes don’t ping, writes Julia Baird. As your arms circle, swing and pull along the edge of a vast ocean, your mind wanders. And you experience awe. Photographs by Katie Orlinsky capture the splendors of pool life. Now get ready to hit the pool. Cannonball!
