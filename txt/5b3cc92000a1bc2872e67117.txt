I chose to be here.” Oliver continued: “You know, I love it here even though the country is kind of at its worst in recent years in terms of its attitude towards immigrants. And I would still make a case for people coming here. That’s the crazy thing. I guess I still — even though I’m not a very optimistic person, I still have a fundamental faith America will correct this path.” In honor of the Fourth of July — this country’s 242nd birthday — I’m recommending a few patriotic reflections that also speak to the difficult current period. Oliver’s emotional interview on “Fresh Air” is one of them. Another is a Times op-ed written last year by Yascha Mounk about becoming an American citizen — and then celebrating by attending a protest. Mounk is a German-born scholar and the author of “The People vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is In Danger and How to Save It.” Mounk’s essay is one of several pieces that my colleague Kathleen O’Brien has curated to mark the holiday. Another of those pieces is by John McCain, the ailing Arizona senator and the subject of a new HBO documentary, “John McCain: For Whom the Bell Tolls.” And in today’s Times, Holly Jackson writes about the long history of protesting on July 4th. Finally, for a bit of an uplift, you can watch Marian Anderson sing “My Country ’Tis of Thee”’ at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939, after being denied the right to perform the song at a Washington auditorium because of her skin color. With the country still struggling through the Great Depression and the world descending into war, some 75,000 people turned out to listen to her.
