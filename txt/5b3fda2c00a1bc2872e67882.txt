OK, I’m going to try to stay with the return of Friday night music, although there may be some disruptions in a couple of weeks when I’m off on bike trips. Since last week was indie music, and next week will probably be something along similar lines, I’ll do an oldie – and topically relevant – one instead. This Tom Lehrer flashback (he really was amazingly good) is for Scott Pruitt, and a reminder of what it was like before the EPA and, perhaps, will be once Trump gets through with it. Make America polluted again!
