CHICAGO — Edith Williams opened the door to her condo in Chicago’s Woodlawn neighborhood and welcomed me into her living room. “You should know, I don’t have a velvet Jesus on the wall,” she said, laughing. I was there to see photographs she has on display of President Barack Obama. But the joke was a shared understanding that black homes across America are full of a familiar array of iconography on the walls, usually including Jesus and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In Chicago, maybe Harold Washington, the city’s first black mayor. And now President Obama. The images are a nod to history, while brightening a wall in a family room with an inspirational figure. The Obama Ms. Williams has on her wall is a framed keepsake from her son — the front page of The Chicago Sun-Times from Nov. 5, 2008, a simple black-and-white image of him. Advertisement “I’m not one to make a big display,” Ms. Williams said. She hung it anyway, thinking her son presented her with the image because of its symbolism. “Coming from the baby boomer generation — a black man becoming president in our lifetime was not realistic.” When voters first sent Mr. Obama to the White House, T-shirts and kitschy wares could be bought all over the South Side. The pride in the photogenic family, the wife and two daughters with winsome smiles was palpable. 
            Arguments and reflections on the president’s tenure and legacy.         In black Chicago homes and businesses, pictures blend in with family photos as if Obama is a cousin or nephew who made good. Coffee table books and magnets. Magazine covers and paperweights. Old Obama Christmas cards sit on curios. One barbershop has a mini-shrine nailed to the mirror. At Haire’s Gulf Shrimp — a takeout with what I consider the best fried shrimp in Chicago — a $125 painting adorns the joint. Nelson Mandela, Dr. King and Malcolm X sit. Mr. Obama stands over them with a wistful smile. It’s hokey but meaningful to the owner, Finnie Haire. “I wanted people to see I was standing for the cause. All the people in picture were for blacks. It means a lot to me,” Mr. Haire said. Several miles away, Peggy Sutton salutes Mr. Obama on all three levels of her contemporary brick home. In the kitchen, she has a framed a black-and-white sketch of the president she bought from a man for $1 at the 63rd Street beach. On the way to the lower level, she hung an oversize Ebony magazine cover of the black cool issue in which Mr. Obama exits a car wearing dark shades. Downstairs is a beaded Obama pillow. Upstairs on display in a spare bedroom is like Obama-palooza: homemade clothes, dollar bills with pictures of the president and the first lady, jeweled Obama champagne flutes, inauguration invitations. “We went crazy,” Ms. Sutton said of her and her friends’ spending spree. “I’m going to miss him very, very much. I just want to remember him,” Ms. Sutton said. She’s kind of tickled as she shows me all of her Obama mementos, remembering just how much she has. Advertisement Ms. Sutton also has a Michelle Obama doll decked out in the Jason Wu replica white beaded inauguration gown. She owns Mayfair Academy, a venerable black dance studio for youths on the South Side, which counts Michelle Obama as an alumna from the 1970s. A photo from that era is also on display in Ms. Sutton’s home. I asked Ms. Sutton what she planned to do with all of her Obama regalia and paraphernalia. It’s not about fandom for her.

Chicago is Mr. Obama’s adopted hometown, and the South Side is his anchor. The city swelled with satisfaction at his election. So when Ms. Sutton says she went “crazy,” she’s coming from a place of having lived through history. Passing down a bit of that tangible history to family members is now Ms. Sutton’s motivation. It’s the same for Ms. Williams, who pointed out that her two granddaughters — ages 3 and 6 — know only a black president. In 2005, Senator Obama attended a Chicago gala celebrating black art and science at the Museum of Science and Industry. Ms. Williams’s son flew in to accompany her. She wanted a picture of the two handsome men in their tuxes. But Ms. Williams didn’t have enough memory on her camera. This predates the smartphone camera era. Undeterred, she made her way back through the crowd to try to take another picture after deleting some photos on her camera. She whipped out the picture for me from a drawer. Ms. Williams is thinking posterity. On a cabinet she has a photo of her grandmother. She said it’s an official photo that is passed out at family reunions, and nearly everyone has a copy. When it was taken, though, her grandmother probably never thought it would become an image for her relatives to display. It was just a photo taken in a moment, one that became more important to her offspring after she died. Ms. Williams compares that photo to the one of her son and Mr. Obama, the future president. It was a moment captured in a crowded room, but now it’s much more than just that moment. Whitten Sabbatini is a documentary photographer currently based in Chicago. Natalie Y.
