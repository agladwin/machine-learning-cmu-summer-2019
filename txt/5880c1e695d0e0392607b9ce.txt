Alex Kosoglyadov has a story that sounds as if it’s out of New York’s glorious past. His parents emigrated from Russia and raised him in a low-income neighborhood in Brooklyn. Alex did well in school and enrolled at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York. There, he was surrounded by highly motivated students, many of them holding down jobs while they went to school and many whose first language was not English. It wasn’t easy, but there was an esprit de corps. “Everyone appreciated the grind it took to succeed,” he said. And yet Kosoglyadov’s story doesn’t come from the past. He is 29 years old now and has a very nice job in Manhattan, as a director at the Bank of Montreal. He’s yet another success story from the City University of New York. My latest column argues that these success stories are much more common than many people realize. A large new research project — analyzing millions of anonymous tax records — found that many colleges are boosting large numbers of low-income students into the middle class and beyond. And they’re not Ivy League colleges. They’re public colleges, like CUNY, Cal State and several University of Texas campuses. For every poor student that the Ivy League launches into the middle class, CUNY alone launches more than six. The most alarming part of the story is that state governments have in recent years been cutting the budgets of these engines of upward mobility. It’s hard to imagine a policy less in keeping with American values — or more damaging to the long-term health of the economy. I hope you’ll read the column. In addition, you can also look up data from the study for any college in the country.
