President Trump arrived at the historic meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea with a secret weapon: a fake movie trailer portraying the two leaders as heroes tied to each other by destiny. The video, which he played for Mr. Kim on an iPad, is full of clichéd, random images and propagandistic messaging. It’s void of any real understanding of the high stakes between the United States and North Korea.  So the Opinion video team recut Mr. Trump’s trailer in an effort to make it better and more honest. But don’t get your hopes up: This movie won’t be coming to a theater near you. Ever.
