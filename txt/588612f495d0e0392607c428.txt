Sean Spicer said so many false things during his first appearance in the White House press room that some of them didn’t even get much attention. He falsely claimed, of course, that President Trump’s inauguration was the best attended in history. (The 2009 Obama inauguration was.) He also falsely claimed that ridership on Washington’s public-transit system was higher this year than in 2013. (It wasn’t.) He said that “floor coverings” had never been used before on the Mall. (They were used in 2013.) He said that “fencing and magnetometers” kept people from reaching the Mall to celebrate the inaugural. (The Secret Service said otherwise.) “This is an appalling performance by the new press secretary,” wrote the usually restrained Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post. Added PolitiFact’s Linda Qiu, “Pants on fire.” The Trump administration — and the president himself — have shown a shocking disregard for the truth in their first days on the job. This disregard puts the media in a tricky spot, because calling out the president of the United States and his staff for untruths will inevitably upset his supporters. But the media cannot waver. We cannot use euphemisms for “false” and “untrue” when those are the accurate terms. Much of the media did indeed rise to the occasion over the weekend. If you haven’t yet seen Chuck Todd’s performance yesterday as host of “Meet the Press,” for instance, it’s worth a few minutes of your time. Not every news source was willing to be bluntly honest, however. The Wall Street Journal’s headline was notably weak: “White House Disputes Inauguration Attendance Estimates, Despite Evidence to Contrary.” I hope the new administration begins to take facts more seriously. But if it doesn’t, the rest of us can’t confuse power with truth.
