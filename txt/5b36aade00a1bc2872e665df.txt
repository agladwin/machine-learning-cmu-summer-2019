OK, this time I really am going to revive Friday Night Music. Regular readers know that back when my blog was clearly distinct from the column, I kicked back almost every Friday by featuring a video performance by a band I liked. But I let the practice slide for a variety of reasons. One reason was a change in format that makes blog posts digitally indistinguishable from regular columns headed for the physical paper. Even though I try to signal the difference with warnings like “wonkish”, I know that many readers still don’t understand that there’s a difference between stuff I write to deadline on Mondays and Thursdays and stuff I post when the mood strikes; I get complaints about “wasting space” even when no trees were killed in the making of a post that’s technical, self-indulgent, or both. And to be fair, some of my off-schedule pieces – even fairly technical expositions — do end up being featured on the home page and even getting a lot of readers. Another reason was the political grimness of our times, which I have to admit put me out of the mood for music posts for a while. But I still find great comfort in music, maybe even especially in these times, and my mid-60s wannabe hipster tastes are still expanding. So I’ll try to share a few of the bands I’m listening to these days, beginning with Chvrches. (The “v” was to make them findable in Google searches!) Now, I know I’m very behind the curve here – this band got big years ago. Also, in principle I should dislike the idea of a synth-driven band with two guys doing the instrumentals while a pretty young woman does the singing. But they really are indie, not some commercial creation, and both the sound and the lyrics, especially on the early stuff, have something elliptical, off-center, and deeply affecting about them. Oh, and the Glaswegian accent is a joy to hear. So here’s a live performance of their biggest hit – apparently only the band’s second public appearance!
