Go Cong, South Vietnam — 1970 A few months into 10th grade, I began to find it hard to pay attention to my homework. I was distracted by the radio and the news about the war. My town was just south of Saigon, near the coast. I was so scared, confused and disillusioned; I started thinking that when I finished my high school diploma I would be 18 and would have no choice but to enlist in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, or face the prospect of being drafted. If I did it right, I would end up a first lieutenant — not a great prospect in a war where young, lower-ranking officers were dying at an unbelievably high rate. I had seen many of my high school friends ahead of me not make it through the first six months of combat after graduating from the Thu Duc Military Academy. By the middle of the school year, I decided to write a letter to the principal asking to have my report cards and high school documents, so that I could submit them to the Air Force academy. I wanted to become a helicopter mechanic. After I passed the physical test and the written entry exam, the Air Force issued me an acceptance paper good until the end of the year. That winter was the last time I celebrated the New Year with my family. Phu Cat — 1972 to 1975 In the summer of 1972, I received a diploma and was assigned to work on CH-47 Chinooks, big twin-rotored cargo helicopters. I was sent to Phu Cat Air Base in central Vietnam, which had been full of American troops until their recent return to the United States. For the United States, the war was ending; for us, it continued. My unit’s job was to support ground troops fighting North Vietnamese Army units in the Central Highlands, near the border with Laos. On the first day out to work on the runway, we had to carry M-16s and wear helmets, because the N.V.A. was close enough to drop mortar shells on us from nearby hills. The attacks happened every morning, while we were out there getting the helicopters ready for their missions — working under fire like that became our daily routine. Even worse, sometimes I would have to fly on the helicopters during the missions, often taking fire as we flew close over the mountains. After six months I got my first two-week vacation. I went home to visit my family and had second thoughts about going back. Con Son Island and the Midway — 1975 On April 28, 1975, I went back to the air base after overextending my four-day leave. Military police officers immediately handcuffed me and locked me in a cell. I remembered that the last time I said goodbye to my girlfriend, her oldest sister told me that whatever happened they would try to go to the main gate of the base and wait for me there.

On April 29, around 2 a.m., as I was sleeping, military police officers opened the door and threw four helicopter pilots into my cell. I asked them what was going on. They said they got caught trying to steal airplanes. I was puzzled. Then they told me that the war was fast coming to an end, and we were losing: The N.V.A. had already taken over most of the cities, and they were marching to Saigon, the capital. Early the next morning, the police came in, opened the jail cells, gave us all our IDs and left in a hurry. I thought about what my girlfriend’s sister had said, so I ran toward to the main gate. As I got closer to the gate, I could see Air Force security and military police with tanks and guns trying to prevent people outside from coming to the base. It was like a war zone; they were shooting at each other. I dropped to the ground to avoid being shot, then crawled and crouched to get to the gate. The gunfire continued. People were running in all directions, panicked and scared. I couldn’t find my girlfriend or her family. Advertisement Around 11 a.m., a radio announcement came over the loudspeakers. Saigon had fallen. Then things really got out of control. Soldiers ripped off their uniforms, grabbing whatever civilian clothes they could find. Intelligence personnel burned their documents. I saw overloaded helicopters hover and crash, with people coming out bloodied, badly injured. Smoke came from the runway. I didn’t know what to do. I ran toward the hangars and bumped into the pilot who was in the jail cell with me the previous night. We ran down to the end of the runway and jumped into an empty UH-1 “Huey” helicopter. As soon as we started the engine, about 20 guys jumped on. The weight was too much; we could barely hover at 10 feet. Fortunately there was another Huey parked nearby, and half of us jumped in and took off. Airborne, we flew out to the sea, like birds escaping a net. I would not set foot in Vietnam again for almost 20 years. We landed on an island called Con Son, where the South Vietnamese government incarcerated political prisoners. There were some high-ranking Air Force officials there; they had arrived the night before from Saigon with their families. We refueled and made a plan. We sent two of the several Hueys on the island to look for an American aircraft carrier, which was stationed farther out in the South China Sea. While we waited, we met the newly freed prisoners; in exchange for some money and jewelry, they fed us lunch with food they had grown on the island. They had no idea what had just happened in Saigon. A few hours later, the Hueys returned — they had found the carrier. There were Chinooks on the island as well, and we all boarded them and flew east. I sat in the tail, with a headset, and listened in on the radio. Vietcong operatives had found our transmissions, and a female voice kept calling us, pleading with us to come back to Saigon, saying that our families were waiting for us, that our country would take us back with open arms and big rewards. I could hear the pilots arguing in the cockpit. They had in fact left their families behind. Suddenly I felt the helicopter turn around. I screamed into the headset: “No, no, we can never trust them! All those words are just lies! We all will be caught and sent to jail! Maybe executed!” Finally they turned back around, and we tried to catch up with our group. A few minutes later, we arrived at the aircraft carrier Midway. As we approached, I saw one Chinook and a couple of Hueys floating upside down in the water near the ship. I thought some of us had missed the landing and crashed. The flight deck below us was crowded with people, planes and helicopters. We had to circle for a while, but eventually the deck crew allowed us to land. As soon as we were out, crewmen took away our helmets, headphones and handguns, and directed the passengers off the flight deck. Then a group of us helped them push the Chinook off the side into the water to make room for more. Advertisement I watched it bob in the water. For a moment I felt lost. Then I turned and followed the line of refugees filing into the ship, as the sun faded on the horizon. Dien Huynh, a veteran of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, lives in New York.
