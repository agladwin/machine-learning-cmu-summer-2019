The first time I saw the famous photo of the 1945 Yalta Conference, I was shocked and enchanted. It seemed like a work of conceptual eclecticism, a collage, for those men were such different figures: Churchill, a servant of her majesty; Roosevelt, a democratically elected president; and Stalin, a bloody dictator. I had this vision when Donald Trump was elected. In the old Yalta, there was a big difference between Stalin and the other two: He cared only about his power. Now I see these leaders — Mr. Trump, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping — and they all seem to care only about their power. This has united them, finally.
