Among the many unresolved issues surrounding the on-again off-again on-again summit meeting in Singapore between Kim Jong-un of North Korea and President Trump is the question of who will pay for Mr. Kim’s hotel accommodations. According to The Washington Post, the “prideful but cash-poor pariah state” requires a foreign country to cover its Supreme Leader’s stay, which may run more than $6,000 a night. And that might be only the starting point of negotiations over lodging. COMMUNIQUÉ OF UNDERSTANDING — RIDER Requirements for hotel for Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un: Hotel must be rated 10-star luxury OR HIGHER, and not booked through Priceline or a Hotel Tonight app. U.S.A. will submit Yelp reviews upon request; AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFICATION for “rude concierge” or “vulnerable to sea approach.” Suite for Supreme Leader Kim must be rated presidential, royal, imperial OR HIGHER. Commissarial, duchal and vizierial suites are specifically deemed NOT ACCEPTABLE. Suite must be same size OR LARGER than suite of U.S.A. President Donald J. Trump, calculated on basis of total square footage, NOT as proportional to heights or volumes of respective leaders. U.S.A. will pay for suite, but Supreme Leader Kim gets the miles. (Supreme Leader’s Emirates Skywards number will be shared with one U.S.A. functionary, who will then become property of D.P.R.K. and live a long and happy life, we promise, on a farm in upstate Ryanggang province.) Hotel staff will not gaze upon Supreme Leader Kim. (Safety measure to limit messy instances of magnificence-induced combustion.) Suite will be stocked before Supreme Leader’s arrival with: 5 Russian prostitutes. (Just kidding. A funny joke between new friends. Relationship progressing well!) But seriously: 1 popular U.S. entertainer. (ENTIRE Laker Girls squad preferable, but Cardi B–Katy Perry duet acceptable. WARNING: Dances to Elton John song “Rocket Man” are hereby deemed NOT a funny joke between new friends.) 88-inch LED Ultra HD 4K television with DVDs of all seasons of “Game of Thrones,” but only the version where King Joffrey doesn’t get poisoned. 5 cases each: little complimentary bottles of shampoo, conditioner, body wash and body lotion. NO LEMON VERBENA. Rosemary mint may also be problem; please consult further. (Note: toiletries strictly for D.P.R.K. delegation; Supreme Leader Kim’s hair, body and skin maintain a constant equipoise of perfect freshness and moisture.) 15 Louis Vuitton Keepall Bandoulière 55 duffel bags. (Each big enough to hold one case of non-lemon-verbena, non-Supreme-Leader-Kim-used complimentary toiletries. U.S.A. will pay extra baggage fees for return flight to Pyongyang.) 6 pairs Big Baller Brand Sho’Time Remix by Lonzo Ball hightop sneakers. (Size 4 youth, but with labels removed and replaced by size 14 men’s labels. IMPORTANT: THIS REQUEST MUST BE KEPT TOPMOST SECRET BY SMALL-HANDED U.S.A. LEADERSHIP IF SMALL-HANDED U.S.A. LEADERSHIP DOES NOT WANT TO BE HUMILIATED IN PHOTO OP WITH SUPREME LEADER KIM WHOSE IRON GRIP HAS BEEN KNOWN TO TURN DRAGON FRUITS INTO DIAMONDS.) 4 dozen Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich package meals. (With chips and cookie, NO FRUIT CUP.) 1 frozen cognac dispenser. (Remy Martin Louis XIII OR BETTER) and unlimited Red Bull (on tap). Note: Supreme Leader Kim’s unexampled physiognomy requires no solid nourishment or liquid refreshment. Chick-fil-A, frozen cognac and Red Bull for ceremonial purposes only. Nevertheless, U.S.A. or host nation will supply as many tasters as perfidy or natural causes demand.  10-foot-by-10-foot plastic tarp and 18-inch bone saw. (Note: Will only be used in case of delegation personnel issues; U.S.A. WILL COVER ANY ADDITIONAL HOUSEKEEPING CHARGE.) 100 lbs. fissile Uranium-235. (Kidding again. Still good friends! And anyway, we have.) But seriously: freesia.
