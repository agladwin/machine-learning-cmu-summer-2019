It’s often difficult to distinguish between what you want to happen and what is likely to happen. I’m going to use today’s newsletter to disagree partially with an op-ed in which I think the authors muddy this distinction. It’s written by Mark Penn, the former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Andrew Stein, the former Manhattan borough president. Penn is a longtime centrist Democrat who played an important role in shifting the party to the center in the early 1990s. And his and Stein’s piece argues for a similar shift today. Democrats, they write, must “reject the siren calls of the left, whose policies and ideas have weakened the party.” They list a series of issues on which the party should move to the right in order to attract working-class votes: trade, immigration, crime, jobs and social issues. To me, this diagnosis is too simple. There are indeed several issues (like immigration, guns and religion) in which polling suggests a more conservative stance — or at least more of a big-tent approach — could help Democrats. But whatever your own ideology, it’s hard to find much evidence that the working class wants Democrats to move to the right on economic matters. Donald Trump, after all, won the Republican nomination and the presidency partly thanks to moving his party to the left — albeit only rhetorically — on economic issues. Ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage keep passing, even in red states. Government health care programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, are so popular that Congressional Republicans can’t figure out how to repeal Obamacare. My view is that the answer for the Democratic Party is more complicated than either a Clinton-esque “third way” centrism or a pure Sanders-esque leftism. But I also encourage you to read the piece by Penn and Stein.
