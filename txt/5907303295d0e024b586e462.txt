This weekend, President Trump continued his bonhomie with Duterte. The two had a “very friendly conversation” by phone, according to administration officials, and Trump invited Duterte to visit the White House. It was the second bit of whitewashing for Duterte this weekend. At a summit of Southeast Asia countries, none of the other leaders pressed him on the thousands of deaths he has overseen, as The Washington Post noted. I’d encourage you to spend a few minutes understanding what’s happening in the Philippines under Duterte. It’s horrendous. Look at Berehulak’s photography, which recently won the Pulitzer Prize. You can also read a Times editorial on Duterte and Miguel Syjuco’s op-ed on the Philippines’ corrupt justice system.
