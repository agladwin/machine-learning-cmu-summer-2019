So, to vote against his party’s cowering congressional caucuses is to affirm the nation’s honor while quarantining him.” Will is no RINO (Republican In Name Only). He is deeply conservative, on a long list of issues. But he recognizes that President Trump represents a threat to American democracy and the rule of law unlike anything else in a long time. He also recognizes that congressional Republicans have proven themselves unwilling to stand up to that threat. The only solution is to vote them out. Will joins a list of other Republicans and conservatives now renouncing the party, including: - Susan Bevan and Susan Cullman (in a new Times Op-Ed) - Tom Nichols - John Ziegler - Pete Wehner - David Frum - Jennifer Rubin - Rich Barlow - Richard Painter Related: In The Daily Beast, Matt Lewis writes about the phenomenon of Republicans against Trump. Vote by mail. My column this week tells the story of Suncrest, a community that straddles Salt Lake and Utah counties, which became home to a kind of natural experiment in voting. The results help highlight why I’ve come to think that voting by mail has a greater potential to lift voter turnout than any of the other reforms currently being proposed. Many of those other reforms, like automatic voter registration, are good ideas, to be clear. But the evidence for the effects of mail-based voting — especially in Utah, Oregon and Washington — is now stronger than the evidence for any other reform. And the fact that Trump managed to become president highlights the problem with America’s low voter turnout.
