What will tonight’s MTV Video Music Awards bring?  Cardi B will make her first appearance since she gave birth to Kulture Kiari Cephus last month. The rapper has the most nominations of any artist tonight; she’s in the running for 10 awards, including artist, video and song of the year. Nicki Minaj, who took to Twitter yesterday to air her frustrations about the fact that her latest album “Queen” came in second to Travis Scott’s “Astroworld,” will perform remotely tonight, from a “secret” location in New York City. The offsite performance will possibly minimize her chances of running into ex-boyfriend, Safaree, whom she fought with on Twitter recently, and from sitting just one row in front Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner.  Among the performers are Ariana Grande, who is expected to sing music from her new album, Sweetener, which was released on Friday. Tonight will also be the pop star’s first time on a red carpet with her fiancé, Pete Davidson. Get excited! The awards are going sans host this year, but Jersey Shore stars Vinny Guadagnino and Pauly D along with Terrence J and Nessa will host the preshow.  It’s a big night for Jennifer Lopez, who will receive this year’s Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award for lifetime achievement, which recognizes accomplishments in music and film. (And, we wish, her MTV Video Music Awards look from 2000.) There are also plans to honor Aretha Franklin, who died last week at age 76. Unfortunately, some nominees, including Drake, Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Bruno Mars and Childish Gambino, will not be attending the event. No word on whether they’ll be at J. Lo’s after-party, though.
