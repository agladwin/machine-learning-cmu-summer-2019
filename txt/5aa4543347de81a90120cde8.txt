Were you distracted by the full Nunberg; that Trumpy trade war (truly, the least bad option of the wars we could be facing, h/t Trevor Noah); or all that storm news? Here are some selections for your weekend reading, in case you missed them the first time around. From the Editorial Board: An alarming new study found that African-Americans and Latinos were far more likely to be denied conventional mortgages than whites even when income, loan size and other factors were taken into account. _____ Before he puts his name to a Supreme Court opinion that is expected to eviscerate public-sector unions, Justice Samuel Alito Jr. should visit West Virginia. _____ You don’t say. A three-part series addressed the history of nepotism and politics and provided close looks at the worrisome roles of both Jared Kushner  and Ivanka Trump. _____ From Op-Ed contributors: Four years ago, there were 15,000 people in Afghanistan working to remove unexploded bombs and grenades. Now there are only 5,000. International donors have scaled back their funding for these operations, but the need is still great, writes photographer Victor J. Blue. The unintentional casualties are civilians, often curious children, who pick up and step on old munitions. _____ Researchers analyzed the diffusion of all of the major true and false stories that spread on Twitter from its inception in 2006 to 2017. Disturbingly, they found that false stories spread significantly more than did true ones. Read a report from the researchers, featured in the “Gray Matter” column from Sunday Review. _____ Reconnecting A.I. with fields like cognitive science, psychology and even sociology will give us a far richer foundation on which to base the development of machine intelligence, writes Fei-Fei Li, the director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab. _____ Since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., officials have been calling for changes in how we handle people with mental health problems. Norman J. Ornstein wrote about his painful experience trying to get help for his son, advocating for both gun reform laws and better resources for the mental health system. _____ The North Korean regime never gives anything away for free, writes Victor Cha, an expert once under consideration to serve President Trump as ambassador to South Korea. _____ Jules Woodson says she was 17 when her youth pastor, Andy Savage, sexually assaulted her. In an Op-Ed video, she offers commentary while viewing Mr. Savage’s apology to his mega-congregation for what he calls a “sexual incident.” He received a standing ovation. _____ The remarkable successes of these directors — and the ways in which they’ve made their heritage part of more-universal movies — is a reminder of how ethnic and cultural diversity can enrich the movie industry. By Ioan Grillo, a contributing writer. _____ How, many wonder, could a Buddhist society — especially Buddhist monks! — have anything to do with something so monstrously violent as the ethnic cleansing now being perpetrated on Myanmar’s long-beleaguered Rohingya minority? Even if we suppose that most Buddhists, or members of any other religious group, really do hold beliefs that are pacifist and tolerant, we have no reason to expect that they will really be pacifist and tolerant. From The Stone series on philosophy. _____ And I will close with a message from a reader: “In some societies the elderly are revered. I don’t wish to be revered, only to be accepted as I am, for who I am, an 88-year-old woman who holds the wisdom of her years and looks it.” (Right there with you, Betty.)
