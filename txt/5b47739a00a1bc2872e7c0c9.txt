In the video op-ed above, family members of victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico demand the government treat Puerto Ricans with the respect they deserve and better prepare for this year’s hurricane season. In May, a Harvard-funded, household-based survey calculated that the death toll of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico is likely 70 times greater than the official estimate. The study put the number of deaths at 4,645. This inspired a Puerto Rican journalist, Gloribel Delgado Esquilín, to co-found Proyecto 4645, a social-media-based movement to promote healing for the relatives of unrecognized victims of the hurricane. The project created an installation in front of Puerto Rico’s Capitol with hundreds of the dead’s shoes, calling on the island’s governor to recognize the real magnitude of the devastation. Gloribel Delgado Esquilín is a Puerto Rico-based writer and artist.
