This is a three-part series of short satirical video cartoons called “Trump Bites” by Bill Plympton, a two-time Oscar-nominated animator.  In Episode One of “Trump Bites,” above, the president humble-brags about the “bigness” of the Oval Office, relishing his own importance. But his small-mindedness and incompetence grow more evident with every boast. “Trump Bites” is a series of three short video cartoons that combine real Donald Trump audio clips with hand-drawn fantasy animations by Mr. Plympton. The video cartoons riff on Mr. Trump’s absurd utterances to illustrate the president’s tumultuous inner life of paranoia, narcissism and xenophobia.  Known for his outrageous sense of humor, Mr. Plympton is an iconoclastic animator who creates irreverent, unsettling and at times disturbing cartoons. He is best known for animated shorts such as “How to Kiss” and “Guard Dog,” and for his contributions to MTV’s “Liquid Television” in the early 1990s. Over the decades, his animations were largely apolitical — until now. The Trump presidency inspired him to extend his provocative art to political satire.  Episode Two: Trump and Putin: A Love Story Episode Three: Donald Trump’s Worst Nightmare The series is produced by Billy Shebar and David Roberts of 110th Street Films. The filmmakers plan to produce additional dispatches, and they started a crowdfunded effort for that purpose.
