The Reader Center is a newsroom initiative that is helping The Times build deeper ties with our audience. In this piece, Paul Krugman, an Op-Ed columnist for The Times and a Nobel laureate, reflects on sending an inaccurate tweet about the presence of cholera in Puerto Rico.  _____ On cholera, in the heat of the moment, I got sloppy. I saw a tweet about cholera from someone I usually take seriously, assumed there was reporting behind it, and tweeted it out. I was wrong, and admitted the error. That’s a warning about Twitter, and how easy it is to be careless; I will be more careful next time. What’s important is not to let some exaggeration distract from the terrible reality in Puerto Rico.
