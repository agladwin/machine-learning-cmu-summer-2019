When I first got to Saigon as a journalist, in 1963, I took it for granted that American policy to counter Communist expansion into the southern part of Vietnam was the right thing to do. That was the conventional wisdom from experience in Europe, where the Soviet Union had established satellite countries on its border. My journalistic perspective in the beginning was “normal.” A good American point of view. As I learned more about the complexities of the war, my journalism became more accurate. The war’s defenders might have said I was becoming more critical, even biased. But in fact I was becoming more objective — I set aside the pro-American, anti-Communist filter I brought with me to Vietnam and reported what I saw. In the news and documentary reports I did, I showed that despite all the destruction, suffering and cost, the war was being lost. Now I’d say it shouldn’t have started. My experience, and that of many, even most, American journalists in the Vietnam War transformed our profession. We realized over the years that the government was ill-informed and even wrong about issues of life and death. As a result of that, reporters today are doing a better job because they know about the evolution of that deception and what its effects have been on American society. When I realized that nothing was working out the way the United States wanted, I began doing TV programs that showed how bad the situation was. Sometimes people in the New York office said, this can’t be right because of what we’re hearing from the White House. I was the bad-news messenger. But I could see that the body-count war was being lost. It wasn’t possible to kill your way to victory in Vietnam as in World War II. History, culture, the evolution of the Communist Party under Ho Chi Minh — things were different from the situation in Europe. Advertisement That breaking point in the “body count” that President Lyndon Johnson wanted, and that Gen. William Westmoreland assured him was close, was a fiction, because those in charge in Hanoi adjusted the level of fighting to suit them, and their young men kept coming because they knew what they were fighting for. President Nguyen van Thieu of South Vietnam never promoted his best officers because he was afraid of a military coup unless he kept his friends in charge of the Army. And the nation-building program, sometimes called pacification, wasn’t gaining enough ground to make any difference. There was no Saigon government in large parts of the country, and it wasn’t the fault of people who lived there that South Vietnamese generals had never been able to govern. Elections were sometimes held, but they were rigged public relations efforts for the benefit of Washington. The rural population in the South was like a second country, and those people mostly supported Ho Chi Minh. They had since after World War II, but especially since Ho beat the French Army in 1954. That was their war of independence, but Washington misunderstood the consequences of Ho’s victory and decided to reverse it. Serious journalists today carry with them an awareness of this history — not necessarily the specifics, but the way the media’s perception of the war matured — when they start work. They’ve read David Halberstam’s book “The Best and the Brightest,” describing the shallow, arrogant views of government officials who didn’t think they needed to know that much about Vietnam, and who were too busy to see the country except as a chunk of geography on the map they wanted to control. Reporters today also know how presidents and their advisers, wary about the next election at home, were afraid of losing some piece of the world to “the Communists” and how paranoia served to perpetuate the fighting when the war had already been lost.

They’ve absorbed the message of Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers, revealed through the courageous reporting of Neil Sheehan of The New York Times. They’ve read the classic books by the historian Bernard Fall on the French and American wars in Indochina. They start off determined to bring insights from the recent past to their reporting about international situations and understand that American elected officials are generally ignorant about other countries. The Vietnam War has ended up putting an unusual burden on young reporters, their newspapers and TV outlets. Too much stress is placed on reporting the latest incremental turn in a story, especially regarding America’s current and brewing conflicts abroad. The news media’s business model depends on it. But to serve the public well, the industry needs the time and space to permit reporters to include a larger context in their reporting from abroad. Otherwise, news becomes “Here they come, there they go” linear reporting about military action that doesn’t have the meaning it needs to permit Americans to understand where these new conflicts are taking us. For me, in my old age, the war comes back, out of order, my subconscious offering up memories without my asking. Here’s one: that time climbing through a hillside bamboo thicket during a military operation when the heat felt so intense it got inside me, and yet I couldn’t seem to drink enough water and was vomiting. I thought I was going to die. Here’s another: The troop-carrying choppers settle onto the rice paddy, mud a foot deep, the men move out, tense because this is a Vietcong area, and they burn the village down, even though the enemy isn’t shooting at them, ignoring the screaming women and children who are trying to keep the fire from taking everything as they run to haul water from their wells in buckets, throwing it up on their burning thatch. In 1995, 20 years after the end of the war, I was asked to do an anniversary report. I chose to go to Beallsville, Ohio, a small town that had too many casualties. One of the veterans I went to see, a Marine, came to the door but didn’t invite me in or shake my hand. I explained what I was doing, a film for PBS about his experience and the town’s loss. He listened, but his expression was hostile. I said I had been in Vietnam myself as a TV reporter for five years over a decade. I tried to think how I could get beyond this awkward moment because sometimes by sharing experience, you can help people realize that you’re with them, not against them. But I couldn’t overcome his hostility so many years after the war was supposed to be over. I thanked him and left. I was probably a reminder of all the bad news that had come out of Vietnam, especially on TV. The news was always too brief and too blunt — the ambush, the mine, the wounded, the medevac helicopter trying to come in to get the men out. Then cut to a commercial. His family might have written to him about what they were seeing and asked, is it like that? It was clear that he resented me, maybe hated what he thought was journalistic misrepresentation of the war as he knew it. Or maybe he knew the bad news was correct but didn’t want to deal with that either. Advertisement There was often resentment among ground troops about “hit and run” reporting — getting news and pictures of the latest firefight by riding helicopters in and out of the battlefield the same day. That style of reporting was a response to pressure from editors back home to get the story out as quickly as possible, to beat the competition, the other wire services, the other networks. Better reporters stuck around for a while, spent the night, shared the combat food rations, the heat and rain, made friends before leaving. So the grunts felt you weren’t just using them, like a stage set to entertain the viewers back home with a little bang-bang, as we used to call it. When the Vietnam War was over, the Pentagon decided that there had been too much negative reporting from the war zone and that it would limit journalists’ access to battlefields. Handouts about what had happened would be prepared by public affairs staff, and officers, called “minders,” would go along with correspondents to supervise their movements and the information they got. A colleague told me that in Iraq, he wasn’t permitted to speak with local people. It’s still possible to find out what’s actually going on under these restrictive conditions, but it’s harder and takes more time. It’s also a lot more dangerous now, because wars have become more violent. Good journalism is always hard to do, but there’s a new generation of reporters who take nothing for granted because of what they know about Vietnam. Their work is everywhere in the best daily newspapers, on cable news and in online newsletters, blogs and websites. Of course journalism is populated by an assortment of people. There’s no entrance exam, so a lot of reporting is done by people who are ignorant and inexperienced about the subjects they pretend to know. Journalism is no better or worse than any other American institution. But the best young reporters have learned from the Vietnam War to question authority and find out for themselves what’s really going on. And that’s how it’s supposed to work in a democracy.
