North Korea will send athletes to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea next month after shunning the Games for eight years. The agreement was facilitated by the South even as its neighbor ramps up its nuclear capabilities. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and his government hope the North will take a break from testing missiles while its athletes participate.
